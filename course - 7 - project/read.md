## About the Data ##

Global Super Store mainly stores data about the orders which have been made by customers. There's information about the order itself such as the customer who made the order, the product requested by the customer and its quantity, the cost which the customer have to pay, and information about shipping. Also, there's information about the customer himself, his name and a detailed address of him. Besides the order and customer information, there's information about the product, its name, category, sub-category, and price.

All those information is stored in __ONLY ONE__ dataset. This makes the data difficult to monitor, analyze, and extract insights! Therefore we need a structured database to store all those information in a simple and easy-to-monitor format.
