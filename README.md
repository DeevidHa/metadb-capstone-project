The capstone project serves as a culmination of the specialization [meta-database-engineer](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-database-engineer#courses), by demonstrating the skillset that constitutes designing and composing a database solution, and the relevant technologies.

## Acknowledgement ** 
This project utilizes synthetic data generated by OpenAI's ChatGPT. Due to the unavailability of the specific data initially intended for use in this capstone project course, I opted to leverage ChatGPT to create a realistic dataset that aligns with the project's requirements. This approach allowed us to proceed with the database and client system development for the Little Lemon restaurant, ensuring the project's continuity and the demonstration of the skills acquired throughout the course.

We want to highlight the importance of synthetic data in this context as a valuable tool for educational and development purposes, especially when access to the desired real-world data is restricted or unavailable. This project serves as an example of innovative problem-solving and adaptability in the face of data acquisition challenges.

## Description 

allowing you to demonstrate a broad spectrum of skills by solving a real-world problem. Each module thoughtfully recaps and connects you to essential content covered in previous courses, ensuring a cohesive learning experience. Your journey will involve setting up a comprehensive database project, incorporating sales reports, creating a table booking system, and working with data analytics and visualization, all while crafting a database client. The Preparation folder will equip you with all the initial files needed to begin this endeavor.
