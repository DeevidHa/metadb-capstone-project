The capstone project serves as a culmination of the specialization [meta-database-engineer](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-database-engineer#courses), by demonstrating the skills that constitutes designing and composing a database solution and the relevant technologies.

## Acknowledgement ** 
This project utilizes synthetic data generated by OpenAI's ChatGPT. Due to the unavailability of the specific data initially intended for use in this capstone project course, I opted to leverage ChatGPT to create a realistic dataset that aligns with the project's requirements. This approach allowed us to proceed with the database and client system development for the Little Lemon restaurant, ensuring the project's continuity and the demonstration of the skills acquired throughout the project.
