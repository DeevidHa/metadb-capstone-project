The capstone project serves as a culmination of the specialization [meta-database-engineer](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-database-engineer#courses), by demonstrating the skills that constitutes designing and composing a database solution and the relevant technologies.

## Acknowledgement ** 
This project utilizes synthetic data generated by OpenAI's ChatGPT. Due to the unavailability of the specific data initially intended for use in this capstone project course, I opted to leverage ChatGPT to create a realistic dataset that aligns with the project's requirements. This approach allowed us to proceed with the database and client system development for the Little Lemon restaurant, ensuring the project's continuity and the demonstration of the skills acquired throughout the project.

## Description 
This  project will design a data solution for the Little Lemon Restaurant. it involves setting upset a database, incorporating `Stored Procedures`, A way to interact with the client and the use of visualization to communicate the data.

tools used:
`MySQL(Workbench)` - For developing and setup of the databsase.
`Python` - Setting up a client and interact with the database.

BEGIN
	UPDATE Bookings SET BookDate = BookDate WHERE BookingID = BookingID; 
	SELECT CONCAT("Booking ", BookingID, " updated") AS "Confirmation"; 
END$$
 
DELIMITER ;
